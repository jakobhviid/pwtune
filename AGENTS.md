# Agent guidelines

Instructions for any AI coding agent (Claude Code, opencode, Cursor, …) working
in this repository.

## Attribution — never attribute AI in the repo

- **Never** add AI/assistant attribution to commits or pull requests: no
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude` (or any other assistant) trailer, and no
  "🤖 Generated with …" line. Author every commit solely as the repository owner.
- AI assistance is disclosed **once**, in the README's "AI disclosure" section —
  that is the only place it belongs. Keep it out of the commit history entirely.

## Where the unfinished work is written down

`ROADMAP.md` holds the work that is understood but not done, the decisions already
taken and why, and the one thing that is not solvable. Read it before proposing
changes to the measurement chain or the tuning defaults — several of those questions
have been settled with reasons, and several others are waiting on a measurement rather
than on an idea.

## Releases & versioning — auto-incremented from commit type

CI cuts a release on every push to `main`, and the version is **derived
automatically from the commit history** (Conventional Commits) — nobody bumps a
version by hand, so a forgotten manual release still versions correctly. The
commit **subject prefix** decides the bump:

- `feat: …` — a new feature → **minor** bump (1.2.0 → 1.3.0)
- `fix: …` — a bug fix / hotfix → **patch** bump (1.2.3 → 1.2.4)
- `feat!: …` (or any `type!:`, e.g. `fix!:`), or a `BREAKING CHANGE` — a breaking
  change → **major** bump (1.4.2 → 2.0.0)
- anything else (`docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, …) or an un-prefixed subject →
  **patch** bump

So **pick the right commit-subject prefix for the change** and the release version
follows automatically. Never hand-edit `version` in `Cargo.toml` to release — CI
computes and stamps it.

computes and stamps it.

## "Documenting the diff" — the doc failure mode, named

Updating a doc or a comment is not the same as narrating the update. The reflex is
to *edit around* the stale sentence so it describes the transition: "this **is** now
checked", "it **no longer** needs root", "skipped **instead of** re-run". Every word
can be true and the doc still be wrong, because it describes your commit rather than
the software.

It costs twice. A reader can't tell a live constraint from a dead one, so the old
state keeps steering them and they route around a problem that is already gone. And
it ages into trivia — one release on, "used to do X" is a fact about a version
nobody runs.

The tells are greppable, so grep **your own diff** before committing: `now`,
`now that`, `no longer`, `used to`, `actually`, `really`, `instead of <the old
behaviour>`, emphatic italics (`*is*` checked — arguing with a claim the reader
never saw), `(fixed in 1.2.3)`, `DONE`.

The fix, in order:

1. **Rewrite as if the new behaviour were the only one that ever existed** — present
   tense, no memory. Keep the *why* only where it is non-obvious and durable.
2. **Then ask whether the line still earns its place.** One that only made sense as
   a contrast with the old state should be *deleted*, not reworded.
3. **Put the before/after in the commit message** — the artefact built for it, kept
   by git with a date and a diff.
